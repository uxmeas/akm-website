# AKM SecureKey: Protecting Critical Industries Worldwide

Cyberattacks on industrial systems are rising 30% annually, costing over $10 billion each year. Legacy PKI-based solutions are no longer sufficient. They’re too manual, too cloud-dependent, and ill-suited for the unique realities of operational technology (OT).

AKM SecureKey delivers a unified, patent-backed cybersecurity framework that protects industrial control systems (ICS) across critical sectors — from energy and manufacturing to utilities and government. Built for air-gapped, constrained, and complex environments, it offers unmatched protection, compliance automation, and seamless platform integration.
