## 🔍 Important Notes:

### ⚠️ GitHub Pages Limitations:
- **Forms won't work** on GitHub Pages (it's static hosting only)
- Contact forms will show but won't send emails
- For working forms, use Netlify instead

### ✅ What WILL work on GitHub Pages:
- All pages and navigation
- Mobile responsiveness
- Images and animations
- SEO meta tags
- Everything except form submissions

## 🌐 Alternative: Deploy to Netlify (Recommended)

For working forms:

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com
2. Sign up/Login
3. Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
4. Connect GitHub and select your repo
5. Deploy with default settings
6. Forms will work automatically!

## 📱 Custom Domain (Optional)

If you have a custom domain:
1. Go to Settings → Pages → Custom domain
2. Add your domain (e.g., www.akmcyber.com)
3. Follow DNS configuration instructions

## ✅ Post-Deployment Checklist

Once deployed, test:
- [ ] Homepage loads correctly
- [ ] All navigation links work
- [ ] Mobile menu functions properly
- [ ] Images load (may take a minute to cache)
- [ ] Check on mobile device

## 🎉 Congratulations!

Remember: For production use with working forms, consider Netlify over GitHub Pages.
