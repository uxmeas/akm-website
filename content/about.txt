# ABOUT AKM

With over a century of combined experience across mission-critical systems and advanced cryptography, the AKM Cyber Corp. leadership team has pioneered the field of quantum-resilient security. Their work spans real-time embedded systems, zero-trust architectures, secure key management, and global standards development for industrial control systems (ICS). From aerospace and defense to rail, energy, and healthcare, AKM’s founders bring a deep legacy of cybersecurity innovation to the world’s most sensitive environments.

This core expertise has been honed through high-impact collaborations with organizations like Boeing, General Dynamics, Magna, Bombardier, Airbus, NSA, NASA, EASA, and the Department of Defense, and continues to shape the future of secure infrastructure worldwide.

# OUR STORY

AKM was founded to solve a problem most in the cybersecurity industry have accepted as unsolvable: how to embed true Zero Trust into every transaction — without relying on legacy Public Key Infrastructure, excessive overhead, or fragile workarounds.

Our founding team came together with over 100 years of combined experience across aerospace, defense, critical infrastructure, and embedded systems. We’ve built avionics for Airbus, security protocols for Boeing, hardened control systems for global rail networks, and contributed to international standards like IEC 62443 and CENELEC TS-50701. We saw firsthand how existing solutions — particularly PKI — fail to scale, struggle to comply, and leave even air-gapped systems vulnerable.

So we built something BETTER.

AKM SecureKey is a quantum-resilient cybersecurity platform that eliminates the need for traditional certificates and central authorities. It’s the only software solution that fulfills all tenets of the CIA Triad — Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability — at the frame level. Our patented architecture ensures every endpoint, every transmission, and every device is authenticated, encrypted, and secure by design. It works offline or online, in a factory, on a satellite, or under the sea.

With a one-time setup, no need for external validation, and zero ongoing maintenance, AKM flips the cybersecurity model from reactive to resilient. And for environments requiring extra hardening, our low-cost hardware companion module brings added protection — with a path to further scalability via FPGA or ASIC.

Today, AKM is trusted by early adopters in energy, manufacturing, healthcare, and defense. We are shaping the future of secure systems — replacing complexity with clarity, fragility with confidence, and assumptions with proof.

This is the cybersecurity rewrite the industry has been waiting for.
