Secure Your OT Future with AKM SecureKey

Cyberattacks on operational technology (OT) environments are rising 30% annually, causing more than $10 billion in global losses. And yet, legacy Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) — the backbone of most OT cybersecurity — is too complex, costly, and brittle to meet today’s standards.

AKM SecureKey is a next-generation cybersecurity framework built for the realities of OT:

✔ Air-gapped or offline systems  
✔ Regulatory pressure  
✔ Resource-constrained devices  
✔ Environments where failure is not an option

Backed by four U.S. patents, AKM SecureKey offers a single, unified solution that delivers implicit Zero Trust, automated compliance, and seamless key management — all with a one-time setup and no ongoing oversight.

# THE AKM ADVANTAGE  
Why AKM SecureKey Solutions

## Drop-In Scalability for Any OT Stack  
The modular, API-driven architecture runs on microcontrollers (<10KB footprint) and integrates seamlessly into any OT platform — without rip-and-replace.

## Unbreakable Security, Anywhere  
Unlike PKI, AKM SecureKey delivers end-to-end symmetric encryption, authentication, and autonomous key rotation without needing a backend connection — perfect for air-gapped and connected systems alike.

## Effortless Compliance, Built In  
AKM SecureKey automates key lifecycles to meet requirements like IEC 62443, EU CRA, and NIST 800-57, generating tamper-proof logs that are audit-ready by design.

# THE AKM SECUREKEY ADVANTAGE

AKM SecureKey is the only single-platform solution that fully addresses the CIA triad — Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability — in both air-gapped and connected OT systems:

**Confidentiality**  
End-to-end symmetric encryption; no certificate authority required

**Integrity**  
Frame-level authentication; prevents spoofing and tampering

**Availability**  
Autonomous self-healing; credentials refresh even when offline

All with Zero Trust built in — no complexity, no assumptions, and no single points of failure.
