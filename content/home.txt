[About Us]

# OUR STORY PREVIEW
A Next-Gen Security Model, Born for the Edge  
AKM was created by engineers who saw how traditional security models were failing the systems that matter most — not laptops or apps, but power grids, pipelines, satellites, and hospital devices.

Rather than patch PKI for OT, we started from scratch.

We’re redefining operational cybersecurity with a next-gen platform trusted by leaders in energy, manufacturing, and beyond. Our mission is simple: Protect the systems that power our world — without relying on the cloud, manual oversight, or assumptions that breaches are inevitable.

# TRUST FRAME (TECH PILLARS)
ZERO TRUST isn't a buzzword. It's built in.

Quantum Resilient  
Framework that authenticates every connection

One-Time Setup  
A setup that runs forever without human oversight

Implicit Zero Trust  
A system that delivers implicit Zero Trust, by default, with every frame

10KB Footprint  
Architected server/client multitrack applications for broadcasting

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
How We Solve The Challenge  
OT Cybersecurity Is Broken

Industrial systems are under siege. Attacks are increasing 30% year over year, causing more than $10 billion in annual damage. And yet, most cybersecurity solutions still rely on outdated Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) — too complex, too manual, and completely unusable in air-gapped or resource-constrained environments.

As regulators demand security by design, organizations are stuck choosing between fragile legacy tools or risky cloud dependence.

# SOLUTION BLOCKS

## Solution #1
Unbreakable Key Protection for Air-Gapped ICS  
Secure disconnected OT environments with AKM SecureKey. Generate, distribute, and rotate encryption keys entirely offline — ensuring critical infrastructure is never exposed.

Benefit: Fortifies systems where cloud-dependent security solutions can’t operate.  
Use Case: Protects SCADA systems in oil refineries from cyber intrusions.

## Solution #2
Streamlined Compliance for OT Key Management  
Simplify compliance and reduce manual overhead. AKM SecureKey automates provisioning, renewal, and revocation of keys across OT devices — helping meet global standards.

Benefit: Saves time and ensures audit-ready operations.  
Use Case: Streamlines the key lifecycle for a factory’s 1,000+ IoT devices.
